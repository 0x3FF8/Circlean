TODO
====

* the script locations should be changed in the next version so they don't sit
   next to the rPi's example development code that ships with the stock rPi
* the system isn't optimised and should be : cleanup and making it as close to
  stock as possible
[Npot sure] Starting process should be more obfuscated
* strip exif data and leave it in a .txt file next to the image it came from
  => exiftool
[Done with remount] set filesystem of OS in RO (physical switch and/or remount OS)
[OK] mount source key in RO and noexec <= also nosuid and nodev
[OK] mount target key with noexec <= also nosuid and nodev
* convert spreadsheets in csv ?
[done in HTML] convert documents (pdfs/*office/...) in images ?
[Not Needed] Have a look at Ghostscript to work on PDFs (.pdf -> .eps -> .png?)
[do everything as user] do not run the conversions as root -> run in chroot
* take eth0 down in /etc/network/interfaces or in the groomer script disable the
  interface before anything happens
* hdmi should stay up: solvable by poking the power management timer
  (better not to disable the PM completely)
[Done] get rid of pdfbox. remove need for java
[WIP] scripts to generate a SD card automatically (win/mac/linux)
* move the scripts away from /opt/
* strip back libreoffice to minimum required packages. in particular, if possible,
  remove libreoffice-java-common package
* Write the groomer log on the destination key
[Done] use /etc/mime.types and file -b --mime-type <filename> to find out the type of
  the file
* Extract metadata fromÂ all the files => https://mat.boum.org/
