Case mechanical design
======================


Notes
=====
- the mechanical design has been created using OpenSCAD
- the Raspberry Pi B Plus Mechanical Drawing is included for reference


Design files
============
The main design file is "myRaspiBp.scad". It is self-documented.
Through parametric configuration, one can generate either the bottom part or the top part
of the case, or both parts. A fit test can also be performed.

Use the file "myRaspBp_Button.scad" to create the push-button.

The design file include "shapes.scad" for common composite shape modules.


Manufacturing files
===================
STL files can be used directly for 3D printing.
The following files are available :
    myRaspiBp_bottom.stl for the bottom part
    myRaspiBp_top.stl for the top part
    myRaspiBp_Button.stl for the push-button.
