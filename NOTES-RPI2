USB Ports
---------

If you connect multiple keys to the Rpi, they will be listed listed that way:

First: Top left
Second: Top right
Third: Bottom left
Forth: Bottom right

tl;dr: as long as the source key (sda) is connected to the top left port, the destination (sdb) can be connected on any other port.
